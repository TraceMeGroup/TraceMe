# Traceability analysis for Model evaluation (TraceMe)
Edit: Jian Zhou
It is the offline version of TraceMe, which is developed for model groups to trace and diagnoise the uncertainty of their model based on multi-model mean and obervation. This version of TraceMe include:
## 1. dataset: multi-model results and observation.
### 1.1 multi-model results:
CMIP6 model resutls, TRENDY model results with different scenarios.
### 1.2 observation data:
obsMIP, opened observation data, experimental data and other data that can be used in evaluating the traceable components.
## 2. framework and codes:
preparation processï¼š read data info, handle processes, and other information used to run the core coding.
main process: handle data according the pre-info.yml; run the calcualtion code to trace the uncertainty; 
## 3. results:
the results includes the data file, figure file, and reports.
